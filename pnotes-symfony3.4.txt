---- Using symfony installer -- #linux
 sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
 sudo curl -LsS https://symfony.com/installer -o /usr/local/bin/symfony
 sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/symfony
Once the Symfony Installer is installed, create your first Symfony application with the new command:
symfony new my_project_name 3.4
 symfony new my_project_name 2.8.3 (specific symfony version)
 symfony new my_project_name 3.1.5
If the installer doesn't work for you or doesn't output anything, make sure that the PHP Phar extension is installed and 
enabled on your computer.
---- Using composer
$ composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition my_project_name 
$ composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition my_project_name "2.8.*"
If your Internet connection is slow, you may think that Composer is not doing anything. 
If that's your case, add the -vvv flag to the previous command to display a detailed output of everything that 
 Composer is doing.
---- Using the symfony standard application (https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard)
a. clone or download the symfony standard application (gets symfony standard 3.4 version)
b. extract to a folder named symfony-v3.4 (will generate an error if trying to run appln)

d. php composer update/upgrade (installs upgraded system from composer.josn and updated composer.lock)
